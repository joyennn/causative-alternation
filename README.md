# Semantic and contextual constraints on the causative alternation in English: A multifactorial analysis 

 Many verbs in English show causative and noncausative uses. The goal of this paper is to identify a factor that is most strongly associated with the realizations of the causative alternation. We report a corpus study which tested effects of three semantic and contextual factors known from the literature – intentionality, cause identifiability, and spontaneity – against 4,180 causative and noncausative uses of 135 alternating verbs extracted from the automatically parsed British National Corpus. Our results of a series of multifactorial analyses of the corpus data show that intentionality and cause identifiability are significantly associated with the realizations and that cause identifiability is the most predictive factor: causative situations with a clear identifiable agent are realized predominantly as a causative, whereas causative situations with a less clear, nonagentive cause are expressed predominantly with a noncausative. Extending Rappaport Hovav’s (2014) and H. Lee’s (2023) accounts of contextual constraints on the causative alternation, we argue that this pattern of form-meaning associations observed in the data can be interpreted as being a consequence of general principles of communicative efficiency − an optimal balance between costs and benefits in language communication.
